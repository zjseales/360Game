# COSC 360 Game (Goo of the Jungle)

My game development group project for the COSC360 paper, at University of Otago.

Made over 5 weeks, in collaboration with:
Eliot Luna, Amaan Aamir, and William Duggan.

#### The game
A simple side-scrolling 2D platformer created using Unity Engine.
3 levels, each level is followed by a boss fight.
Defeating a boss will unlock a  new ability, allowing the player to transform into the animal they just defeated.

The built game can be played at: https://cosc360.otago.ac.nz/games/2022/GooOfTheJungle

I've uploaded this as an addition to my portfolio while looking for work.
